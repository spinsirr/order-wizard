# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 23, 2026

## Overview

Amazon Order Wizard ("the Extension") is a browser extension that helps users save and manage their Amazon orders. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data.

## Data We Collect

### Order Data
When you click "Save to Wizard" on an Amazon order, we collect:
- Order number
- Product name
- Order date
- Product image URL
- Price

This data is **only collected when you explicitly choose to save an order**. We do not automatically collect or monitor your browsing activity.

### Account Data (Optional)
If you choose to sign in for cloud sync, we collect:
- Email address (from your authentication provider)

## How We Store Your Data

### Local Storage (Default)
By default, all order data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third party
- Persists until you delete it or uninstall the extension

### Cloud Sync (Optional)
If you sign in, your order data is synced to our secure cloud servers. This enables:
- Access to your orders across multiple devices
- Backup of your data

Cloud data is:
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Associated with your user account
- Deleted upon request

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Browsing history
- Passwords or payment information
- Data from non-Amazon websites
- Any data without your explicit action

## Third-Party Services

### Authentication
We use AWS Cognito for optional authentication. When you sign in, your authentication is handled by AWS according to their privacy policy.

### Amazon
We access Amazon order pages only when you visit them. We do not have access to your Amazon account credentials.

## Data Sharing

We do **NOT**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your data for advertising purposes
- Transfer your data for purposes unrelated to the extension's functionality
- Use your data to determine creditworthiness

## Your Rights

You can:
- **View** all your saved data within the extension
- **Export** your data to CSV at any time
- **Delete** individual orders or all data
- **Sign out** to stop cloud sync
- **Uninstall** the extension to remove all local data

## Data Retention

- **Local data:** Retained until you delete it or uninstall the extension
- **Cloud data:** Retained until you delete it or request account deletion

## Security

We implement appropriate security measures including:
- HTTPS encryption for all data in transit
- Secure authentication via OAuth 2.0
- No storage of authentication credentials

## Children's Privacy

This extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date.
